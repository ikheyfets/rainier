# Predicting success of a Mt. Rainier summit attempt

### Motivation:

As an avid outdoorsman, I'm always looking for my next adventure. The first time I visited the PNW and saw Rainier I knew I had to climb it! And as a data scientist, I have decided to apply my knowledge to build a model that would predict my success at a summit, while I'm mentally and physically training for it. 

### Dataset:

I have obtained the dataset for summit attempts in 2014-2015 from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codersree/mount-rainier-weather-and-climbing-data), however, I was not able to access the original dataset from http://www.mountrainierclimbing.us/routes. I have reached out to Mt. Rainier National Park in hopes to get raw data, but have not heard back yet.
